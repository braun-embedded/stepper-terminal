# Stepper Terminal

**Please consider supporting this project financially. More information below.**

## About

Allows you to control a stepper motor from your PC via a CLI app that sends commands to a firmware application running on an [LPC845-BRK] development board.

The firmware application uses the [Stepper] library to control the motor. It is intended to serve as a testbed and usage example for Stepper. This project and Stepper are part of [Flott], an open source toolkit for motion control software in Rust.


## Status

This project is under development.
